# Xception_image_classification

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of the Xception Model, based on the paper: "Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions."

## Overview
The Xception Model is a powerful deep learning architecture that utilizes depthwise separable convolutions for efficient and effective feature extraction. This implementation provides an example of training the Xception Model on the Asian vs African Elephants dataset from Kaggle.

## Customization
To use this network for your own purposes, you can easily customize it by following these steps:
1. Replace the dataset files with your own dataset files.
2. Modify the appropriate names in the code to match your dataset and class labels.
3. Adapt the training and evaluation process as needed for your specific task.

## References
For more details about the Xception Model and depthwise separable convolutions, please refer to the following paper and the Keras implementation of the model:

## Dataset
You can access the Asian vs African Elephants dataset used in this example from the following link:
[Asian vs African Elephant Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivmankar/asian-vs-african-elephant-image-classification)

Please make sure to download the dataset and adjust the code accordingly for your own dataset if you decide to use this implementation.

Feel free to explore and adapt this implementation to suit your needs. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.
