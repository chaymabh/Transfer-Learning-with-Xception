# Xception_image_classification

TensorFlow implementation of the Xception Model, based on the paper: Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions.

As an example, the model will be trained on the Asian vs African Elephants dataset from Kaggle.


## Customization :
You can simply change the dataset files and the appropriate names to use the network for your own purposes.
