# Transfer-Learning-with-Xception
Apply an neural network approach in order to perform a binary image classification on the kaggle dataset "Asian vs African Elephants". The chosen approach consists in the use of a pre-trained model through Transfer Learning: the neural network used in this work is Xception from the tensorflow library.
